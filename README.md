I am a begginer web-developer.
I did this project from watching video of Traversy Media https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSTQzlprGLI.
And I added some weather and air quality forecast into my homepage based on my geolocation.
I am using weather data from AirVisual API https://www.iqair.com/air-pollution-data-api.
